              Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you were blocked on
              a simple problem:
            </h3>
            <!-- Question 1 -->
            <p>
              So, the other day I was working on this coding exercise, and it
              involved something called 'objects' â€“ think of them like little
              containers that store information. The task was simple: add a new
              piece of info to the container. Now, I hadn't used objects much
              before, so I figured it'd be some complex process with special
              commands. I initially went looking on a site called MDN web docs,
              which is where I stumbled on this method called defineProperty,
              and it seemed like overkill for such a basic task. I spent way too
              long trying to figure it out, feeling like I was missing something
              obvious.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, after some short frustration, I Googled it. Turns out, it
              was as easy as saying "Hey container, here's your new info!" It
              was just like adding a new item to a list, using a simple equals
              sign. I felt a bit silly for overcomplicating things, but hey,
              that's how you learn, right? Sometimes the simplest solution is
              the one you overlook when you're still learning the ropes.
            </p>

            </h3>
            <!-- Question 2 -->
            <p>
              I was working on this final JavaScript exercise - known as JS
              Olympics for my code challenges. Before that, I'd been practicing
              with prior exercises, and it turned out they were the perfect
              warm-up! It was like each exercise before had given me a piece of
              the puzzle, and suddenly, when I got to that final challenge, I
              knew exactly how to solve them.
            </p>
            <p>
              It felt super smooth and elegant, like I was barely even thinking.
              I just knew what tools to use and how to put them together. It was
              kind of like those moments when you're playing a game, and you're
              just in the zone. All that practice really paid off, in the end

            <h3>
              Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these
              problem-solving techniques/processes:
            </h3>
            <!-- Question 3 -->
            <h4>Pseudocode</h4>
            <!-- H -->
            <p>
              The "pseudocode" approach is a core element of my problem-solving
              toolkit. I have grown in confidence significantly through both
              guided and independent practice. While the JavaScript Kata
              provided helpful examples of pre-written pseudocode, it only
              further solidified the concepts in my mind. Due to my experience
              with the JavaScript Cafe exercise, that actually primed my
              understanding of using pseudocode. In that exercise, I actively
              used pseudocode to map out the rough logic and structure of my
              code before diving into the actual implementation. This process
              proved invaluable in organizing my thoughts and breaking down
              complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps. Through this
              combination of learning from examples and applying pseudocode
              independently, I now feel very comfortable utilizing this
              technique to plan and design effective solutions for various
              programming challenges.
            </p>
            <h4>Trying something</h4>
            <!-- H -->
            <p>
              The "try something" approach is another core element of my
              problem-solving toolkit, especially when coupled with pseudocode.
              It's a dynamic and iterative process: I begin by sketching out a
              rough plan using pseudocode, breaking down complex problems into
              smaller, more manageable tasks. Then, I actively experiment with
              potential solutions, knowing that not every attempt will be
              successful. This approach embraces the learning process inherent
              in coding, where each "failed" attempt provides valuable insights
              and guides me toward a more refined solution.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have developed a strong sense of confidence in the "try
              something" technique through extensive practice in the JavaScript
              exercises of this course. It's a method that aligns well with my
              learning style and comfort with experimentation. The iterative
              nature of coding, where small adjustments and refinements lead to
              progress, makes this approach particularly effective. Even when
              faced with challenging problems, I am confident in my ability to
              generate ideas, test them out, learn from the results, and
              ultimately arrive at a workable solution.
            </p>
            <h4>Rubber ducky method</h4>
            <!-- H -->
            <p>
              I am familiar with the concept of rubber duck debugging and have
              even experimented with it in the past. I understand the value of
              articulating a problem aloud to an inanimate object, as it forces
              me to break down complex issues into simpler steps and often
              reveals hidden assumptions or errors in my thinking. However, I
              haven't fully integrated this technique into my regular
              problem-solving toolkit.
            </p>
            <p>
              I tend to rely on a similar approach of talking through problems
              out loud, but my audience is usually myself rather than a rubber
              duck. I find this verbalization extremely helpful in clarifying my
              thoughts and identifying flaws in my logic. While I acknowledge
              the potential benefits of using a physical object as a sounding
              board, I haven't yet experienced a situation where I felt the
              rubber duck method would provide a significant advantage over my
              current practice. However, I remain open to exploring it further
              and incorporating it into my problem-solving repertoire as needed.
            </p>
            <h4>Reading error messages</h4>
            <!-- H -->
            <p>
              I feel quite confident reading error messages, both those
              generated by my own code and those provided by JavaScript itself.
              When working through exercises like the JavaScript Kata, I find
              pre-defined error messages valuable for pinpointing specific
              issues and confirming expected outcomes. They offer a structured
              way to evaluate code and learn from mistakes. In the broader
              context of JavaScript development, the built-in error messages are
              often descriptive and informative, providing crucial details about
              the location and nature of errors, which significantly streamlines
              the debugging process.
            </p>
            <p>
              While error messages are undoubtedly a vital tool in my
              problem-solving arsenal, I also recognize their limitations.
              Pre-defined error messages, while helpful, can sometimes lack
              nuance and may not capture the full complexity of certain issues.
              This is where understanding the underlying JavaScript concepts and
              developing debugging skills become crucial. In my experience, the
              combination of both self-constructed and built-in error messages,
              coupled with a growing knowledge of JavaScript principles, has
              fostered a sense of competence and comfort in navigating and
              resolving code errors. I'm continually refining my ability to
              interpret these messages effectively and use them as a guide to
              create more robust and reliable code.
            </p>
            <h4>Console.logging</h4>
            <!-- H -->
            <p>
              I feel incredibly confident using console.log as a problem-solving
              technique. It's like having a direct line of communication with my
              code, allowing me to peek inside and see what's happening at each
              step. By strategically placing console.log statements throughout
              my code, I can track the values of variables, the flow of
              execution, and pinpoint where errors might be occurring. This
              visibility is invaluable, especially when dealing with complex
              logic or unexpected behavior.
            </p>
            <p>
              console.log is not just about identifying problems; it's also
              about confirming correct behavior and understanding how my code
              works. I use it to verify that functions are receiving the
              expected input, that loops are iterating as intended, and that
              conditional statements are evaluating correctly. This proactive
              approach saves me a significant amount of time and frustration
              during the debugging process. By leveraging console.log, I can
              quickly narrow down the source of an issue and implement targeted
              solutions with confidence.
            </p>
            <h4>Googling</h4>
            <!-- H -->
            <p>
              Initially, I viewed Google with some skepticism, leaning heavily
              on official documentation like MDN Web Docs for JavaScript
              solutions. While MDN is invaluable for precise syntax and in-depth
              explanations, it doesn't always provide the quickest path to
              solving a specific problem. Recognizing this, I shifted my
              perspective on Google, appreciating it not just as a crutch, but
              as an efficient tool in its own right. Google opens up a vast
              landscape of alternative solutions, forum discussions, and even
              direct links to the relevant MDN documentation I might have
              otherwise missed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through this shift, my confidence in using Google has grown
              significantly. I've learned to leverage its strengths, such as
              quickly surfacing diverse perspectives and code examples. While I
              still value the rigor of MDN, I now understand the power of
              combining both resources. Google serves as a starting point for
              exploration, often leading me to the official documentation with a
              clearer understanding of the problem at hand. This newfound
              confidence in using Google has empowered me to tackle challenges
              more efficiently, knowing I have a versatile tool at my disposal.
            </p>
            <h4>Asking your peers for help</h4>
            <!-- H -->
            <p>
              While I haven't yet needed to request help directly from my peers,
              I've actively engaged in discussions and offered assistance when
              others have faced challenges. These experiences have been both
              enjoyable and educational, reinforcing the value of collaboration.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently, my problem-solving strategies and resources have been
              sufficient to overcome obstacles within a reasonable timeframe.
              However, I'm confident in my ability to seek peer assistance
              should the need arise. I recognize the importance of reaching out
              before excessive time is invested in a single issue, and I would
              not hesitate to leverage the collective knowledge of my peers to
              find solutions.
            </p>
            <h4>Asking coaches for help</h4>
            <!-- H -->
            <p>
              Similar to "Asking your peers for help", I haven't yet encountered
              a coding challenge that has stumped me completely. I'm aware that
              the complexity of problems will increase as I progress in my
              studies and I understand that asking for help is a natural and
              essential part of the learning process, so I wouldn't hesitate to
              seek guidance from a facilitator / coach if I find myself stuck
              for an extended period.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm confident in my ability to communicate my thought process,
              articulate the specific issues I'm facing, and actively
              participate in the problem-solving discussion. I believe a
              facilitator can provide valuable insights, alternative
              perspectives, and ultimately lead to a more efficient resolution.
              I'm committed to utilizing all available resources to overcome
              obstacles and continue my growth as a developer.
            </p>
            <h4>Improving your process with reflection</h4>
            <!-- H -->
            <p>
              I find immense value in the process of reflection as a tool for
              enhancing problem-solving skills. While the other techniques offer
              immediate solutions during the heat of the moment, reflection
              provides a deeper understanding after the fact. It allows me to
              analyze my approach, identify stumbling blocks, and pinpoint areas
              where my knowledge or skills could be strengthened. This
              retrospective analysis is crucial, as it often reveals subtle
              nuances or missed opportunities that might not be apparent during
              the initial problem-solving phase.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have great confidence in the power of reflection, as I
              consistently incorporate it into my learning process. I maintain
              detailed notes and reflections on the challenges I encounter, the
              solutions I implement, and the lessons I glean from each
              experience. This deliberate practice of self-assessment allows me
              to internalize new knowledge, refine my techniques, and approach
              future problems with a more informed and strategic mindset. By
              actively reflecting on my past successes and setbacks, I am
              continuously improving my problem-solving abilities and building a
              stronger foundation for tackling future challenges.

            </h3>
            <!-- Question 4 -->
            <p>
              I have yet to properly experience the reluctance to seek help
              directly related to problem-solving within a given timeframe of
              exercises. While I recognize the value of seeking assistance, I
              tend to persevere independently and haven't yet encountered a
              situation where my progress was hindered due to not asking for
              help. My inquiries so far have been more for clarification or
              convenience rather than essential for task completion. Although I
              haven't needed to formally request assistance for exercises, I'm
              confident in my ability to do so if the need arises.
