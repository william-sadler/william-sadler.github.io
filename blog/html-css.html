            In this blog post we'll be discussing the CSS position property and
            it's values. As the name suggests, the position property defines the
            positioning of an <strong>element</strong> in an html document for a website's
            design, using a specified value. These <strong>values</strong> include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Static</li>
            <li>Relative</li>
            <li>Fixed</li>
            <li>Absolute</li>
            <li>Sticky</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            While there are many different types of values for the this property, in the blog post, we'll only be covering the most common values that are used in almost every modern website.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>What is Relative positioning?</h3>
          <!-- RELATIVE -->
          <p>
            The relative value is just as the name suggests. When used in a
            position property, it denotes the type of positioning of an element
            that is <strong>"relative"</strong> to its original location in the document. That
            may sound like a mouthful… <strong>But let me explain!</strong> 
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's say you wanted to move a plant pot a little to left from where
            it is currently. While you may just pick up the plant pot and move
            it over a little, websites aren't as smart as we are. First, we need
            to define how we want to move it! Some questions the website would
            ask are: move from where it was? Move from the where the floor is?
            Move from where you are looking? These are all important values to
            define for the website to understand what you are trying to do with
            your element, or in this case, your plant pot.
          </p>
          <section class="blog-example">
            <pre><code class="language-css">
.plantpot-relative {
  position: relative;
  top: 30px;
  left: 50px;
  padding: 70px; 
  border: 5px solid #9a54c5;
}
          </code></pre>
          <div class="plantpot-relative">
            <div class="old-relative">
            </div>
            <div></div>  
          </div>
        </section>
          <!-- Example -->
          <p>
            In this example, you can clearly see the original position in a
            faded color and it's new position in the purple color! We moved the
            plant pot 50 pixels away from the left and 30 pixels away from the
            top of where it was originally placed.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's important to note that when we specify the direction and
            distance, we will always be defining those directions as "the
            distance away from it". So if you defined 50px with the left
            direction, you are actually moving the plant pot further to the
            right of its original position. Which is why we say "away from the
            left", to make it easier to understand, so you don't trip yourself
            up and wonder why your plant pot is in the wall.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>What is Absolute positioning?</h3>
          <!-- ABSOLUTE -->
          <p>
            The absolute positioning value, while not as simple as relative
            positioning, it is still pretty easy to understand. It's difficult
            to explain what absolute positioning is, with how it's named.
            However, the best I can do is say that instead of the position being
            relative to its original location, we are defining a "child element"
            absolutely in relationship to its "parent element". That's a lot to
            understand, but let's walk this through once more!
          </p>
          <p>
            let's say you have some flowers (child element), and you'd like to
            put them into the plant pot (parent element) that you just moved!
            Once you've placed these flowers inside the pot, it seems like you
            placed them a little off center, so you move the flowers around a
            little to make sure they are neatly placed in the correct position
            inside your plant pot. In this case, websites are pretty smart; they
            already understand the flowers are inside the plant pot, but what
            they don't understand is that you want to move them around a little!
            They also have no clue how you want to move them around. Some
            questions the website ask are: Where are you moving them from?
            Relative to its original position? Or based on a container your
            flowers are inside of (the plant pot) instead? So let's give it a
            try!
          </p>
          <section class="blog-example">
            <pre><code class="language-css">
.plantpot-relative {
  position: relative;
  top: 30px;
  left: 50px;
  padding: 100px;
  border 5px solid #9a54c5;
}
.flowers-absolute {
  position: absolute;
  right: 20px;
  bottom: 20px;
  padding: 45px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  border: 5px solid #f7b424;
}
          </code></pre>
          <div class="plantpot-relative-hidden">
            <div class="flowers-absolute"> <!-- div -->
            </div>
          </div>
        </section>
          <!-- Example -->
          <p>
            In this example, you can clearly see that the orange flowers
            (the child element) have been positioned 20 pixels away from the
            right and 20 pixels away from the bottom of the purple plant pot
            (the parent element). Notice how the position of the flowers is
            entirely dependent on the position of the plant pot? If we were to
            move the plant pot, the flowers would move along with it,
            maintaining their "absolute" position in relationship to the pot!
          </p>
          <section class="blog-example">
            <pre><code class="language-css">
.plantpot-relative {
  position: relative;
  top: 70px;
  left: 30px;
  padding: 100px;
  border 5px solid #9a54c5;
}
.flowers-absolute {
  position: absolute;
  right: 20px;
  bottom: 20px;
  padding: 45px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  border: 5px solid #f7b424;
}
          </code></pre>
          <div class="plantpot-relative-hidden" style="top: 70px; left: 50px;">
            <div class="flowers-absolute"> <!-- div -->
            </div>
            <div class="old-hidden-relative"></div>
          </div>
        </section>
          <!-- Example -->
          <p>
            This is the main difference between relative and absolute
            positioning. Relative positioning moves an element dependent on its
            original location, while absolute positioning moves an element
            dependent on the parent elements positioning (in this case, the
            plant pot). If there is no positioned parent element, the element is
            positioned in relationship to the next positioned parent element,
            which is usually the HTML document itself (in this case, the house).
          </p>
          <p>
            It's important to understand that when we are defining the absolute
            value, CSS doesn't know which element you want it to be paired with
            unless you define the parent element with the position property,
            which it should have the "relative" value applied to it. Even if the
            parent element does not need to be positioned, it still requires the
            "relative" value so that the child element understands where it's
            placement should be.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>What is Fixed positioning?</h3>
          <!-- FIXED -->
          <p>
            Fixed positioning, unlike its relative and absolute counterparts, it
            can be a bit trickier to grasp. While other values base their
            positioning on visible elements within the HTML document, fixed
            positioning takes a different approach. It positions an element
            based on the viewport (the visible area of your browser), completely
            detached from the normal flow of the document. Let's break down this
            concept once again!
          </p>
          <p>
            Imagine a sticker (child element). You place this sticker on the
            window of a car door (think of this as the viewport). Now, picture
            yourself driving down the road. The scenery outside is whizzing by –
            trees, buildings, mountains – everything is in motion. But the
            sticker? It remains stubbornly "fixed" in the exact spot where you
            placed it on the window!
          </p>
          <p>
            In a website, the concept is very similar, but with a few nuances.
            If you simply placed the sticker on your house (html document), as
            you drove away, the sticker would vanish from sight. Similarly, in a
            website, you need to specify where on the viewport (the "window" of
            the website) you've placed the sticker! If you don't, it might end
            up on the car door, or even your seat – technically still on the
            car, but completely out of view from your window (the viewport).
          </p>
          <p>
            Since you, the web developer, are essentially the "person in the
            car" in this analogy, and the window represents the visible website
            area, the sticker (your element) needs to be positioned within that
            viewable area for users to see it!
          </p>
          <section class="blog-example">
            <pre><code class="language-css">
.sticker-fixed {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 20px;
  right: 20px;
}
          </code></pre>
          <div class="viewport-fixed">
            <div class="sticker-fixed">
              I'm a fixed Element
            </div>
          </div>
        </section>
          <!-- Example -->
          <p>
            In this example, you can clearly see that the sticker is positioned
            20 pixels away from the bottom and 20 pixels away from the right
            edge of the "viewport" (your window), regardless of how much the
            user scrolls or resizes the window. It's like a constant companion,
            always there in the corner of their eye as they navigate website.
          </p>
          <!-- You may have noticed to the bottom right, there is a button. That’s a fixed element! -->
          <p>
            Fixed positioning is your go-to tool when you need an element to
            stay put on the screen, regardless of user interaction. This can be
            incredibly useful for navigation menus, chat widgets, social media
            icons, or any element that you want to remain consistently
            accessible.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's important to understand that unlike relative and absolute
            positioning, fixed positioning doesn't rely on a parent-child
            relationship or any reference to other elements within the html
            document. It operates independently, taking its cues directly from
            the viewport!
          </p>
          <p>
            This means you don't need to worry about applying position: relative
            to any parent elements when working with fixed positioning. Simply
            apply `position: fixed` to the element itself, along with the
            desired top, bottom, left, or right values to specify its exact
            location within the viewport.
          </p>
          <p>
            Keep in mind that fixed elements can overlap other content on the
            page as the user scrolls, so be mindful of their placement to avoid
            obstructing important information or functionality.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>In conclusion</h3>
          <!-- CONCLUSION -->
          <p>
            Understanding the nuances of CSS positioning is crucial for anyone
            looking to craft visually appealing and user-friendly websites.
            Whether you need to shift elements slightly with relative
            positioning, precisely place elements within parent containers using
            absolute positioning, or design elements that remain ever-present on
            the screen with fixed positioning, the possibilities are endless.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember, choosing the right positioning method depends entirely on
            your specific design goals. Experiment, practice, and don't be
            afraid to combine these techniques to achieve the perfect layout!
            With a solid grasp of CSS positioning, you'll unlock a new level of
            control and creativity in your web development journey.
          </p>

            I hope this guide has shed light on the fascinating world of CSS
            positioning. Now go forth and create stunning websites that leave a
            lasting impression!
