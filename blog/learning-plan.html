            <p>
              My personal long term goal is to develop video games. I envision
              myself working within a collaborative team, where I can learn from
              experienced professionals and share my own my passion for game
              design, programming, and storytelling. I was hoping that by
              attending the Dev Academy course, I could build upon my knowledge
              and help me reach into that side of the industry.

              <strong>Strengths:</strong>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Passion and Intrinsic Motivation: My genuine enthusiasm for
                  programming serves as a powerful driving force. When I'm
                  engaged with a topic that interests me, my curiosity becomes
                  insatiable. I'm eager to explore new concepts, experiment with
                  code, and dive deep into the intricacies of software
                  development. This intrinsic motivation fuels my persistence,
                  even when faced with challenging problems.

              <li>
                <p>
                  Self-Directed Learning: I thrive in environments where I can
                  take ownership of my learning journey. I'm proactive in
                  seeking out resources, tutorials, and online courses that
                  align with my goals. I enjoy the freedom to set my own pace,
                  explore topics that spark my interest, and create projects
                  that allow me to apply my knowledge in practical ways.

              <li>
                <p>
                  Problem-Solving Mindset: Programming has honed my ability to
                  break down complex challenges into smaller, more manageable
                  steps. I approach problems with a systematic mindset, drawing
                  upon my logical reasoning and analytical skills to identify
                  solutions. I'm not afraid to experiment, iterate, and learn
                  from my mistakes along the way.

              <strong>Limitations:</strong>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Overcoming Frustration: While my passion fuels my learning, it
                  can also lead to impatience when I encounter obstacles. I have
                  a tendency to give up too easily on difficult concepts or
                  projects. I recognize the need to develop greater resilience
                  and perseverance in the face of setbacks. Learning to embrace
                  challenges as opportunities for growth will be crucial for my
                  continued development.

                  Balancing Breadth and Depth: My enthusiasm often leads me to
                  explore a wide range of topics within programming. While this
                  breadth of knowledge is valuable, I sometimes struggle to
                  strike the right balance between exploring new areas and
                  mastering specific skills in depth. I need to be more
                  intentional about prioritizing my learning goals and
                  dedicating focused time to deepening my expertise in key
                  areas.

                  Seeking Guidance and Collaboration: I used to prefer working
                  independently, but I'm starting to recognize the value of
                  seeking guidance and collaborating with others over the years.
                  Engaging in discussions with fellow learners, mentors, or
                  online communities can offer fresh perspectives, help me
                  overcome roadblocks, and accelerate my learning journey. Even
                  though I can struggle a little to open up in an online
                  environment compared to a real world environment.

              To ensure timely assistance, I'll proactively seek help from a

              experienced programmers who can hopefully offer insights and
              guidance. Additionally, I'll utilize available resources such as

              troubleshoot issues.
