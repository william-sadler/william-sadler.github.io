            <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
            <!-- Question 1 -->
            <p>
              As we approach the end of the foundations phase and transition
              into the bootcamp section of the course, my long-term goals and
              career pathway remain steadfast. I aspire to leverage the skills
              and tools provided by Dev Academy to pave my way towards becoming
              a games developer. Although this course primarily focuses on web
              development, teaching us HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I recognize
              the immense value in the fundamental skills we are
              learning—problem-solving, emotional intelligence, and efficient
              learning strategies. These skills are universally applicable
              across all programming languages and highly sought after by
              employers. I aim to bring my passion and skills to the video game
              industry, contributing to major projects and series, and
              continually learning from seasoned professionals to further my
              growth in this dynamic field.
            </p>
            <p>
              While I don't have a specific destination in mind regarding
              location, I have always harboured a strong desire to travel
              extensively, experiencing new places, countries, landmarks, and
              diverse cultures. Although New Zealand's video game market is
              relatively small, I am eager to seize opportunities that might
              take me abroad to larger industries that recognize my potential
              and are willing to foster my growth. My ultimate goal is to make a
              significant impact in the video game industry, helping to create
              immersive and innovative gaming experiences while continuously
              expanding my horizons both professionally and personally.

            <h3>
              What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be
              in Bootcamp?
            </h3>
            <!-- Question 2 -->
            <p>
              During the Foundations phase, I discovered a strength that I
              hadn't initially recognized: my patience and perseverance.
              Initially, I listed patience and perseverance as limitations,
              believing I tended to give up easily based on past experiences.
              However, throughout this course, I've realized that those
              experiences were outdated. Over the years, I have grown
              significantly as a person, and I now approach challenges with much
              more resilience and determination. This newfound strength has been
              evident in how I tackle problems, whether helping peers or working
              through my own issues. I invest considerable time and effort into
              being patient and persevering, turning what I once thought was a
              weakness into a powerful asset. This strength will undoubtedly
              serve me well during Bootcamp, enabling me to face difficult tasks
              and complex problems with a calm and steady approach.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the flip side, I've also identified a potential limitation: my
              stubbornness. I have a tendency to spend excessive time on solving
              problems independently, driven by the satisfaction of overcoming
              challenges on my own. While this trait has served me well in
              Foundations, where I had the luxury of extra time each week, I
              realize it may become a hindrance in Bootcamp. The increased
              workload and tighter deadlines will require me to be more
              efficient and collaborative. I must balance my determination with
              a willingness to seek help from peers and facilitators when
              needed. Recognizing this limitation early on is crucial, as it
              will remind me to utilize the resources available and not let my
              stubbornness impede my progress in a more demanding environment.

            <h3>
              What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp
              will be?
            </h3>
            <!-- Question 3 -->
            <p>
              The biggest non-technical challenge for me during Bootcamp will
              likely be a combination of maintaining focus and adhering to my
              schedule while staying on top of the material. As someone who
              occasionally struggles with staying disciplined, especially when
              juggling multiple tasks, I foresee these aspects becoming
              increasingly difficult as the program progresses. While I've been
              diligent about keeping up with the material so far, the escalating
              difficulty level of the coursework might present a greater
              challenge in terms of time management and sustained concentration.
              Balancing these elements will be crucial to my success, and I am
              aware that it will require a consistent effort to prevent falling
              behind.
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, as the Bootcamp intensifies, I expect the pressure to
              remain organized and focused will grow significantly. It will be
              essential for me to develop and stick to a structured routine,
              allowing for adequate study time, breaks, and periods of
              reflection. The cumulative nature of the material means that any
              lapse in focus or schedule adherence could have a domino effect,
              making it harder to catch up. Therefore, I plan to employ
              strategies such as setting specific, achievable goals, using
              productivity tools, and seeking support from peers and mentors to
              ensure I stay on track. By being proactive and adaptable, I
              believe I can overcome these challenges and maximize my learning
              experience at Bootcamp.

            <h3>
              What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
              developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
            </h3>
            <!-- Question 4 -->
            <p>
              While at Dev Academy, I am eager to enhance a variety of human
              skills that will complement my technical learning and prepare me
              for a successful career in software development. One of my primary
              goals is to improve my ability to actively seek guidance and
              collaborate with others when faced with challenges. I recognize
              that seeking help and input from peers and mentors is crucial not
              only for overcoming obstacles but also for fostering a
              collaborative learning environment. By developing this skill, I
              hope to become more comfortable in asking questions, sharing my
              struggles, and contributing to collective problem-solving. This
              will not only help me grow individually but also enable me to be a
              supportive and engaged team member.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, I am keen on honing my communication skills, both in
              conveying my ideas clearly and listening effectively to others.
              Effective communication is the backbone of any successful team,
              and I want to ensure that I can articulate my thoughts, provide
              constructive feedback, and also be receptive to feedback from
              others. I am also interested in learning more about teamwork and
              peer-to-peer collaboration, as these skills are essential for
              working efficiently in group settings. Furthermore, developing
              leadership skills is a significant area of interest for me. I aim
              to understand how to lead by example, motivate team members, and
              manage group dynamics to achieve our collective goals. By focusing
              on these human skills, I believe I will become a more well-rounded
              professional, capable of contributing meaningfully to any project
              or team I am part of.

            <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
            <!-- Question 5 -->
            <p>
              My primary expectation from the Bootcamp team is that they possess
              extensive experience in running the program and understanding the
              diverse ways students engage within this learning environment. I
              hope the team is adept at recognizing patterns that indicate when
              certain students might need additional support. This could involve
              identifying moments when students are struggling with the
              material, experiencing uncertainty, or showing reluctance to
              participate. A proactive approach in these situations, coupled
              with a positive and encouraging mindset, would be incredibly
              beneficial. It would be reassuring to know that the team is not
              only aware of these challenges but also equipped with strategies
              to help students navigate through them effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, it’s important to me that the Bootcamp team actively
              seeks to provide help and alleviate any concerns that students may
              have. This includes being responsive to requests for assistance
              and fostering an environment where students feel comfortable
              reaching out for support. I would appreciate if the team could
              motivate and guide students who might be hesitant or confused
              about the coursework or upcoming projects. While I understand that
              these expectations can be challenging to meet, seeing some of
              these practices in action would greatly reduce my anxieties and
              enhance my confidence as I progress through the course. Overall,
              having a supportive and attentive Bootcamp team would make a
              significant difference in my learning experience and help me make
              the most of this opportunity.

          <div>
            <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
            <!-- Question 6 -->
            <p>
              My expectations of myself during Bootcamp are centred around
              proactive engagement, continuous improvement, and effective
              collaboration. I aim to fully leverage the resources and
              opportunities provided, particularly the weekly 1:1 sessions with
              bootcamp facilitators. These sessions are invaluable for technical
              queries, progress updates, and addressing any issues or questions
              that arise. Additionally, the human skills check-ins will be
              crucial for maintaining my emotional well-being and ensuring I am
              equipped with the soft skills necessary for both personal and
              professional growth. I am also aware that support extends beyond
              these scheduled meetings; facilitators are available when urgent
              help is needed, and peers can also be a significant source of
              assistance. These various support avenues, ranging from in-person
              interactions on campus to online platforms like Zoom, Discord,
              email, and Slack, ensure that I can seek help in a timely manner
              regardless of the situation. As the Bootcamp progresses, I
              anticipate that the structure and accessibility of these resources
              will become even clearer, helping me navigate the course more
              effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
              To manage my workload effectively in the Bootcamp, I will commit
              to a structured and disciplined approach to my learning. This
              involves meticulously planning and adhering to a comprehensive
              schedule, much like I did during the foundation phase. Keeping a
              detailed journal, logging my progress, and maintaining both
              short-form daily and weekly reflections will be critical
              components of this strategy. By asking powerful, probing questions
              in these reflections, I can extract valuable insights to discuss
              with facilitators or peers, ensuring continuous improvement. This
              method not only keeps me organized but also helps in identifying
              and addressing any learning gaps promptly. By following this
              disciplined approach, I can build a flexible yet robust learning
              plan that adapts to my needs and the demands of the Bootcamp,
              ensuring that I remain productive and on track.
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, I am committed to fostering a positive and
              collaborative learning environment. This includes practicing safe
              habits such as mindfulness sessions, taking well-timed breaks, and
              scheduling regular journaling and reflection periods. These
              practices are essential for maintaining my mental and emotional
              health, which in turn enhances my ability to work effectively with
              others. By prioritizing these habits, I can ensure that I am
              contributing positively to my team, facilitators, and
              industry/community representatives. This approach to managing my
              workload and well-being will empower me to maximize my
              productivity and support the learning and success of those around
              me. Through consistent reflection and adaptation, I am confident
              that I can meet and exceed the expectations set forth by the
              Bootcamp, creating a fulfilling and enriching experience for
              myself and my peers.

              To ensure timely assistance, I'll proactively seek help from a

              like Discord, Slack or Github to connect with fellow learners and
              experienced programmers who can hopefully offer insights and
              guidance. Additionally, I'll utilize available resources such as
