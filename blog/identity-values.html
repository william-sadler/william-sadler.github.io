            <h3>
              1. Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision.
              Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision,
              the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
            </h3>
            <!-- Question 1 -->
            <p>
              Ethical decision-making is a difficult process. Weighing values
              and decisions based on your morals can be a rather emotional, and
              sometimes even illogical, decision-making process. An example in
              my personal life would have been with a relationship. Morally, I
              believe in chance, loyalty, truth, and action over words. My
              ethical decision to stay in the relationship caused great pain for
              myself, due to illogical and emotional experiences that weighed my
              morals far above my own mental health. Reflecting back on that
              situation, I realize that my morals shouldn't be applied to every
              individual. That realization helped me grow deeply as a person.
              While in some cases, sticking to what you believe in as right or
              wrong is a powerful decider in life, reality loves to stick around
              in a big gray area, where ethical decision-making never has a
              black or white answer and always teeters on being unclear.

              2. Describe how your culture and the people around you have
              influenced your values and identity.
            </h3>
            <!-- Question 2 -->
            <p>
              I've grown up around people with open-minded and reflective
              personalities who respect those close to them and always seek a
              positive attitude. I've definitely been influenced toward a growth
              mindset over the years, well before Dev Academy. I understand that
              everyone is different, and expecting the same value from every
              conversation is a notion that should never be considered. I feel
              the best way to express my values and identity is to meet the
              person behind the story, understanding that words can only speak
              so loud compared to actions.

              3. Identify your strengths and how they will support you during
              your learning journey.
            </h3>
            <!-- Question 3 -->
            <p>
              I have a strong growth mindset, am a quick learner and can easily
              relate and connect new learning to prior experiences. I'm also
              good at building habits and enjoy chatting with and helping
              others.

              4. Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
              development. How might these affect your learning journey?
            </h3>
            <!-- Question 4 -->
            <p>
              I easily get overwhelmed. I might be good at building a habit, but
              that's different from a routine. If I step too far away from my
              schedule, it can be difficult to keep on track. I get easily
              paranoid. I can very easily misunderstand a conversation or topic
              and I tend to lack motivation.

              5. Share an example of when you were trying to work productively
              with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss
              strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and
              your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and
              why.
            </h3>
            <!-- Question 5 -->
            <p>
              My experience working with others or in a team can vary
              dramatically, depending on the individual I'm working with. I'm a
              bit of a social chameleon; I don't have a major preference.
              However, I'm always reflecting on my experiences, especially
              working with another. Situations like being in a work environment
              with a team tend to work more like clockwork. It's less about
              managing the individuals, in my experience, than providing a
              positive reflection in others' minds of yourself to boost morale
              and improve team spirit. Generally, if tension arises, that
              tension is addressed. If you have a problem with a teammate, or
              someone has an issue with you, you address that problem and work
              through to solve it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most of the time, being a people person is really important for
              this skill, because arguing with someone about an issue will
              result in either nothing changing or it becoming worse. So solving
              a problem with another is usually a collaborative solution: "What
              can I do to solve this issue?" "What would benefit you the most to
              help you solve this problem?" These are useful phrases I would use
              in solving a problem. Never make it about the person, always put
              the pressure on you, as it gives the person the ability to control
              the solution and find their own answer and, in some cases, put
              some pressure on themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
              For individual work, it's a similar process. If I have tension in
              the process, I'll ask myself if there is a solution, and if there
              isn't, I'll ask them if there is something they need from me to
              solve the tension, and rinse and repeat.
