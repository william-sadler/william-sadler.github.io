            <h3>Fundamentals of JavaScript</h3>
            <!-- Question 1 -->
            <p>
              Ever built a Lego house that looked amazing but couldn't do
              anything? That's HTML and CSS for you - the bricks and the paint
              job. JavaScript is the invisible magic that brings your creation
              to life. It's the secret sauce that makes websites interactive,
              dynamic, and downright fun! Imagine clicking a button and watching
              colors change, text appear, or animations dance across the screen.
              That's JavaScript at work.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you've dabbled in HTML and CSS, you've laid the groundwork for
              a fantastic digital adventure. Now, it's time to inject some
              personality and pizzazz into your projects. This blog post will be
              your guide, your companion on the journey to mastering JavaScript
              fundamentals. We'll start with the basics, explore essential
              concepts, and even sprinkle in some code examples to get your
              creative juices flowing. By the end, you'll be armed with the
              knowledge and skills to transform your static webpages into
              interactive masterpieces.

            <h3>JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.</h3>
            <!-- Question 2 -->
            <p>
              Let's begin by describing the relationship between JavaScript,
              HTML, and CSS. I've already mentioned the basics: "HTML being the
              bricks of a Lego house, while CSS is the color, shape, and size of
              those bricks." JavaScript, however, needs a more comprehensive
              analogy to better explain what it can do – and it can do a lot!
            </p>
            <p>
              Imagine a well-crafted dollhouse. The HTML is like the structure
              of the house – the walls, floors, and roof. It defines the layout
              and where each room and element should be. It looks something like
              this:
            </p>
            <h3>HTML</h3>
            <section class="blog-example">
              <pre><code class="language-html">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;My Dollhouse&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div class="room" id="living-room"&gt;Living Room&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="room" id="kitchen"&gt;Kitchen&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="room" id="bedroom"&gt;Bedroom&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
              </code></pre>
            </section>
            <h2>Dollhouse Design</h2>
            <section class="blog-example-iframe">
              <iframe
                src="/blog/dollhouse.html"

            </section>
            <p>
              The CSS is like the interior design – the paint colors, wallpaper
              patterns, furniture styles, and decorations. It gives the house
              its unique look and feel. It looks something like this:
            </p>
            <h3>CSS</h3>
            <section class="blog-example">
              <pre><code class="language-css">

#bedroom {
  background-color: lightpink;

            </code></pre>
            </section>
            <h2>Dollhouse Design</h2>
            <section class="blog-example-iframe">
              <iframe
                src="/blog/dollhouse-css.html"

              ></iframe>
            </section>
            <p>
              But even with a stunning structure and design, the dollhouse lacks
              life and interactivity. That's where JavaScript steps in.
              JavaScript is like the puppeteer who brings the dollhouse to life.
              It can open and close doors, turn lights on and off, make the tiny
              inhabitants dance, and even change the layout of the house on the
              fly! Just like a puppeteer controls the actions of the dolls,
              JavaScript controls the behavior and interactivity of a website.
              It responds to user actions like clicks, hovers, and scrolls, and
              updates the HTML and CSS to create dynamic and engaging
              experiences.
            </p>
            <h3>Javascript</h3>
            <section class="blog-example">
              <pre><code class="language-js">
function toggleLights() {
  let room = document.getElementById('living-room');
  if (room.style.backgroundColor === 'lightblue') {
    room.style.backgroundColor = 'darkblue';
    room.style.color = 'white'
  } else {
    room.style.backgroundColor = 'lightblue';
  }
}
            </code></pre>
            </section>
            <h2>Dollhouse Design</h2>
            <section class="blog-example-iframe">
              <iframe
                src="/blog/dollhouse-js.html"
                width="100%"
                height="400px"
                style="border: none"
              ></iframe>
            </section>
            <p>
              But JavaScript's power extends beyond mere puppetry! It's also the
              brains of the dollhouse, capable of storing information, making
              decisions, and even communicating with the outside world!
              JavaScript can remember user preferences, track game scores, fetch
              data from external sources, and update the website's content in
              real-time. It's like if you and a friend were role-playing inside
              the dollhouse, keeping track of various shenanigans you get up to
              along the way – JavaScript keeps track of information and what you
              have been up to in a similar fashion, making the website smarter
              and more responsive to your actions!
            </p>
            <p>
              With JavaScript, the possibilities are endless. You can create
              interactive games, build complex animations, validate user input,
              and even create entire web applications that run within the
              browser. JavaScript is a versatile and powerful tool that empowers
              web developers to build immersive and dynamic experiences that go
              far beyond static HTML and CSS. Just like a master puppeteer can
              create an entire world within a dollhouse, a skilled JavaScript
              developer can create an entire universe within a website.

            <h3>Control Flow and Loops</h3>
            <!-- Question 3 -->
            <p>
              Now it's time to dive into some basic concepts you should know
              when it comes to writing javascript! starting at Control Flow:
            </p>
            <p>
              Control flow is the order in which the computer executes
              statements in a script. Code is run in order from the first line
              in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the
              (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such
              as conditionals and loops!
            </p>
            <h4>Making a Sandwich</h4>
            <p>
              We are pretty smart when it comes to language, and I'll explain
              what I mean. If I told you, "I made a sandwich," you could
              probably easily imagine the process of making a sandwich! You
              follow a specific order: grab bread, add meat, cheese, veggies,
              and maybe some sauce. While you can't simply ask your computer to
              make a sandwich, it does complete a process one step at a time.
              This ordered process is known as control flow in programming. It
              dictates the steps your code takes, one after the other.
            </p>
            <p>
              But what if I wanted to make two sandwiches? That's where loops
              come in! Loops are like repeating a part of the sandwich-making
              process. You'd loop through the "add ingredient" step multiple
              times, placing bread, meat, cheese, etc., until you have the
              desired number of layers for your next sandwich. In code, a loop
              lets you repeat a block of instructions as many times as needed.
            </p>
            <h4>Making Multiple Sandwiches</h4>
            <section class="blog-example">
              <pre><code class="language-js">
for (let sandwichCount = 0; sandwichCount &lt; 3; sandwichCount++) { 
  console.log("Grab bread"); 
  console.log("Add meat and cheese"); 
  console.log("Add veggies"); 
  console.log("Enjoy your sandwich!");
}
            </code></pre>
            </section>
            <p>
              This code creates three sandwiches. The for loop controls how many
              times we repeat the steps inside the curly braces {}. Each time
              through the loop, we increment sandwichCount. The loop continues
              as long as sandwichCount is less than 3.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now you know what control flow is! Each instruction is executed
              one after the other, "from top to bottom," until it reaches a
              loop. The loop repeats a set of instructions until it has reached
              the desired number of repetitions. I hope you're keeping up,
              because this is a lot of information!
            </p>

            <h3>The All Important DOM</h3>
            <!-- Question 4 -->
            <p>
              Now that we have the basics for the relationship between
              Javascript, CSS and HTML and have some fundamentals for how
              control flow and loops interact inside of Javascript. Let's talk
              about how all of these parts fit together! This is the special
              sauce and it's one of the most important parts, when it comes to
              bringing your website to life!!
            </p>
            <p>
              The Document Object Model (DOM) is the heart of interactive web
              development! Think of it as a living representation of your web
              page's structure, content, and styling. When your browser loads a
              website, It's a tree-like structure representing every element on
              your webpage: headings, paragraphs, images, buttons, and more.
              Think of it as a map of your website's structure, where each
              element is a node in this tree.
            </p>
            <div class="example-dom-img">img</div>
            <p>
              JavaScript on its own is a powerful programming language however,
              while JavaScript grants you the power to create worlds onto
              themself, it cannot directly manipulate the visual structure of a
              webpage on its own. This is where Web APIs, like the DOM, step in.
              They serve as intermediaries, exposing methods and properties that
              allow JavaScript to "talk" to the browser and access the
              document's content. Without these APIs, JavaScript would be
              limited to internal calculations and wouldn't be able to create
              the dynamic, engaging experiences we expect from modern websites.
            </p>
            <p>
              The DOM allows you to select specific elements using methods like
              document.getElementById, document.querySelector, or
              document.querySelectorAll. Once you have a reference to an
              element, you can change its content, style, or even add and remove
              elements entirely. This dynamic manipulation is how you create
              interactive features like dropdown menus, image sliders, and
              real-time updates.
            </p>
            <h4>Example Button</h4>
            <section class="blog-example">
              <pre><code class="language-js">
const myButton = document.getElementById("myButton"); // Find the button in the DOM
myButton.textContent = "Click Me!"; // Change the button's text
myButton.style.backgroundColor = "green"; // Change the button's background color
myButton.addEventListener("click", function() { 
  alert("You clicked the button!"); // Make something happen when the button is clicked
});
            </code></pre>
            </section>
            <button id="myButton"></button>
            <script>
              const myButton = document.getElementById('myButton') // Find the button in the DOM
              myButton.textContent = 'Click Me!' // Change the button's text
              myButton.style.backgroundColor = 'green' // Change the button's background color
              myButton.addEventListener('click', function () {
                alert('You clicked the button!') // Make something happen when the button is clicked
              })
            </script>
            <p>
              In this snippet, document.getElementById is a DOM method that
              searches the DOM tree for an element with the ID "myButton." Once
              found, we can modify its properties (like text and style) or add
              event listeners to trigger actions (like the alert) when the
              button is clicked. This is just the tip of the iceberg—the DOM
              offers a wide array of methods to interact with your web page,
              making it a vital tool for creating dynamic and interactive
              websites.
            </p>
            <p>
              The DOM transforms a static HTML document into a living, breathing
              entity. By combining the power of JavaScript with the structure of
              the DOM, you unlock endless possibilities for creating engaging
              and interactive web experiences. The DOM is a fundamental concept
              for any aspiring web developer, as it empowers you to build
              websites that respond to user input, update in real-time, and
              deliver dynamic content.

            <h3>Arrays and Objects</h3>
            <!-- Question 5 -->
            <p>
              Arrays and objects are both ways to store data, similar to how an
              old phone book or a contacts list on your phone stores
              information. While both are used to store data, they do so in
              different ways and have different methods for accessing and
              displaying that data.
            </p>
            <h4>Ordered Collections vs. Key-Value Pairs</h4>
            <p>
              Arrays are like organized lists. They hold an ordered collection
              of data, where each item has a numerical index starting from zero.
              Accessing elements in an array is straightforward: you use their
              index within square brackets (myArray[2]). This is ideal for
              storing sequences of values where the order matters, like a list
              of names or a series of steps in a process.
            </p>
            <h4>Arrays</h4>
            <section class="blog-example">
              <pre><code class="language-js">
// Creating an array
let myArray = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'];
                
// Accessing elements
console.log(myArray[0]); // Outputs: Alice
console.log(myArray[2]); // Outputs: Charlie
            </code></pre>
            </section>
            <p>Objects, on the other hand, are collections of key-value pairs. Each piece of data is associated with a unique key (a string), which acts as its label. To access values in an object, you use either dot notation (myObject.name) or bracket notation with the key as a string (myObject['age']). Objects are great for representing structured data, like a person's profile (with keys like "name," "age," and "address") or the settings for an application.</p>
            <h4>Objects</h4>
            <section class="blog-example">
              <pre><code class="language-js">
// Creating an object
let myObject = {
  name: 'Alice',
  age: 25,

            <h4>Numerical Indices vs. String Keys</h4>
            <p>The fundamental difference in how you access data stems from this distinction in structure. With arrays, you're working with numerical indices to pinpoint specific items in a sequence. This makes it easy to iterate over arrays using loops. With objects, you're using descriptive string keys to access particular values. This makes objects more flexible for representing complex data structures, but you'll often need to know the exact key names to retrieve the information you want.</p>

            <h3>Functions</h3>
            <!-- Question 6 -->
            <p>Let's go back to the control flow analogy, when I was talking about how control flow operates through a step by step process and how we as people can take a simple phrase like make a sandwich, bake a cake or build a house and understand that it's a step by step process that dictates certain actions? Well computers actually can be asked to make a sandwich! But it's not as simple, let me explain:</p>
            <p>Imagine giving a computer a vague instruction like "make a sandwich." It wouldn't know where to start! Functions solve this problem by breaking down complex tasks into manageable steps, much like a recipe. In programming, a function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific action. It's similar to a loop but not quite! Giving the computer that detailed list of instructions: get bread, add meat, add cheese, and so on. By organizing code into functions, you make your programs more organized, easier to read, and less prone to errors.</p>
            <h4>Function</h4>
            <section class="blog-example">
              <pre><code class="language-js">
function makeSandwich(filling) {
  console.log("Get two slices of bread.");
  console.log("add " + filling + " on one slice.");
  console.log("Put the slices together.");
  console.log("Enjoy your sandwich!");
}

            </section>
            <p>The true power of functions lies in their reusability. Instead of writing the same code repeatedly for similar tasks, you define a function once and call it whenever needed. This not only saves time and effort but also makes your code more efficient. Think of a function like a kitchen appliance – <strong>you don't rebuild a blender every time you want a smoothie;</strong> you simply use it whenever you need it. Functions allow you to create modular code that's easy to maintain and adapt to different situations.
            </p>
            <h4>Calling a Function</h4>
            <section class="blog-example">
              <pre><code class="language-js">
makeSandwich("peanut butter and jam"); // Call the function with a specific filling
makeSandwich("ham and cheese");        // Call the function again with a different filling
            </code></pre>
